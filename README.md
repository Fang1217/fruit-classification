# Fruit Classification Using VGG13 Transfer Learning

This project demonstrates how to classify different types of fruits using a pre-trained VGG13 model through transfer learning. The dataset used is the "Fruits Dataset" from Kaggle, which contains images of various fruit types. Transfer learning with VGG13 helps create a highly effective image classifier.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages VGG13â€™s convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- **Custom Layers**: Adds fully connected layers for fine-tuning to the fruit classification task.
- **Data Augmentation**: Uses augmentation to enhance training performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes model metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Dataset

The dataset is based on the [Fruits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyapmaher/fruits-dataset-images/data).

## Installation
